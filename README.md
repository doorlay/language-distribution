# Zipf's law mapper
Checks frequency of word appearances in a text document, maps against Zipf's law

Zipf's law states that a logarithmic distribution appears in many things in life, one of these being language.
According to Zipf's law, the most used word in any language shows up twice as frequently as the second most used. 
It also shows up three times as much as the third most used word, continuing said Zipfian pattern. 

This program checks for that Zipfian pattern in .txt files.

# Running  
Place your .txt file in the same folder as the project.
Run with `python zipf.py`, enter the file name when prompted. Results will come out in a file titled "out.txt".
